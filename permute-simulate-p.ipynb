    "There is a group $\\mathcal{G}$ of transformations from $\\mathcal{X}^N$\n",
    "to itself, such that\n",
    "if the null hypothesis $H_0$ is true, $\\mathbb{P}$ is invariant under $\\mathcal{G}$.\n",

    "every $g \\in \\mathcal{G}$, $\\mathbb{P} \\{ (X_j) \\in A \\} = \\mathbb{P} \\{ (X_j) \\in g(A) \\}$.\n",

    "For any pre-specified test statistic $\\phi(X)$, we can estimate a $P$-value by generating uniformly distributed random elements of the orbit of the data under the action of the group (see [Mathematical Fundations](./math-foundations.ipynb) if these notions are unfamiliar).\n",

    "Note that this (conditional) probability involved has two sources of randomness:\n",
