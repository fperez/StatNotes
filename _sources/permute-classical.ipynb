    "### Why use ranks instead of the original data?\n",
    "\n",
    "+ In some problems, only ranks are observed. This is common when it is possible to make comparative judgements about outcomes, but not absolute judgements. For example, a doctor might be able to rank a collection of patients according to the severity with which they suffer from some disease they share, but might _not_ be able to rate the severity on an objective quantitative scale&mdash;and certainly not an equal-increment scale, e.g., a scale for which 5 is \"better than\" 4 by the same amount that 2 is \"better than\" 1. Similarly, a consumer might be able to order a collection of items by preference: she prefers A to B, B to C and C to D, for example. Yet she might not be able to quantify the strength of her preferences. Having techniques for dealing with ranks is then useful. The same issue occurs with measurements on Likert scales.\n",
    "+ If the measurements are \"contaminated\" by outliers, using ranks can decrease the sensitivity to the outliers, potentially increasing power.\n",
    "+ If the original data have no ties, the null distribution of the rank-based statistic is \"universal\": can tabulate it once and for all. (This is less important than it used to be because of increases in computing power.)\n",
    "+ Often, the normal approximation to the null distribution of the rank-based statistic is more accurate than the normal approximation to the null distribution of the test statistic for raw data. (This is less important than it used to be because of increases in computing power.)\n",
