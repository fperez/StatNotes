    "and some of its advantages and limitations.\n",
    "State the strong null hypothesis for the randomization model (the Neyman model) and the typical weak null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For the randomization model, state some pros and cons of the Wilcoxon rank sum test versus a permutation test based on the sample mean or on the permutation distribution of the $t$ statistic, compared with the parametric two-sample Student $t$-test. For each test, state the null hypothesis under which the nominal $P$-value of each test is its true $P$-value. \n",

    "1. Show mathematically that the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (which uses the sum of the ranks of the treatment group as the test statistic) is equivalent to the Mann-Whitney test (which uses the number of (control, treatment) pairs for which the control response is less than the control response as the test statistic), in the sense that they reject the null for the same data sets. (It's enough to show that their relationship is monotonic.) You may assume that there are no ties in the data, so the (mid-)ranks are $\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$.\n",

    "1. Consider an experiment involving 9 subjects, 5 assigned at random to treatment and 4 to control. We want to test the null hypothesis that \"treatment makes no difference\" at significance level 10%. For each individual, we measure a quantitative response. Think about the omnibus alternative, about the one-sided shift alternative that treatment increases the response, and about the two-sided shift alternative that treatment increases or decreases the response. Consider four tests: the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (using mid-ranks for ties), a permutation test based on the difference in the sample means for the control and the treatment groups, the Smirnov test, and a 2-sample $t$-test based on the difference in the sample means for the control and treatment groups.\n",

If the power depends on additional unspecified features of the problem, such as the baseline responses of the subjects, explain what those features are, and estimate the power for a few different values of those features.\n",

    "    5. For one-sided versions of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, the permutation test using the sample mean, and the $t$-test, and for the Smirnov test, find the (nominal) $P$-values for the following hypothetical data, and the power against a shift alternative that treatment increases the response by one unit:\n",

Implement the simulation two ways: one by taking the first $n$ elements of a pseudorandom permutations (the PIKK algorithm) and the other by directly constructing pseudorandom samples. Provide unit tests and a coverage report for the functions you write.\n",

What is the largest number of objects for which that generator can give you all permutations? Is there an option in the package to use a better pseudo-random number generator?  If so, which one? What algorithm does the package use to generate permutations? What algorithm does the package use to generate random samples?\n",

In each case, identify the \"scientific\" invariance and the corresponding group invariance for the data.
